# Taste All Tropic

## Steps to be taken:
### Brainstorm the main features of 'Taste All Tropic' application:
- What is the main purpose of the application?
- What are the main features?
- What are the main actors involved?
- What are the main events that occur in the application?
- What are the main challenges and opportunities?

### Place the feature ideas on Whiteboard and start Event Storming session (Big Picture)
- Use Orange Notes for Domain Events
- Use Pink Notes for Catch-up Concerns
- Use Yellow Notes for Actors
- Use Blue Notes for Commands
- Use Green Notes for Read Models
- Use Purple Notes for Policies
- Use White Notes for External Systems
- Use Red Notes for Commands that are not yet implemented
- Use Grey Notes for Commands that are not yet implemented but are planned

#### Chaotic exploration: Orange Notes — Domain Events:
1. with verb in Past Simple
2. meaningful for the domain we try to discover 
3. main building block for the whole business process

#### Timeline order:

#### Pivotal Events: focus on most crucial business events in process first
1. Swimlanes: divide whiteboard on rows; each for their autonomic process; linked to a different actor, system or department in our Domain 
2. Temporal Milestones: divide whiteboard on strategic time scopes: day after, week after, month after, year after etc.; closer to the core of the process the division should be shortened

#### Hot Spots: Pink Notes - Catch-up Concerns:
1. written as questions
2. DO NOT solve it immediately: remarks to follow up later

#### Actors: Yellow Notes — People and Systems:
1. as triggers of (sequence of) events 
2. People as manual triggers 
3. Systems as manual/automatic triggers — not necessarily within our control → "whatever we can put the blame on"

#### Verification: Logic of the timeline check:
1. Telling the story from last item to first OUT LOUD!
2. Validate the chronology of events: adding new items if necessary

#### Repeatable
Challenges & opportunities:
